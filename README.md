# Robo Sapiens FTC Java Library

## Team Number: 14503

### Season: 2024-2025

Welcome to the Robo Sapiens' official FTC Java Library for the 2024-2025 season! This library is designed to streamline the development of our robot’s software and enhance our competitive performance in the First Tech Challenge (FTC).

### Features

Our library integrates several powerful tools and libraries that enhance our robot's capabilities:

- **Roadrunner**: We’ve implemented Roadrunner, a motion planning library, to help with trajectory generation and path following. This allows our robot to navigate the field more efficiently, executing complex maneuvers with precision.

- **OpenCV**: To improve our robot's vision capabilities, we've integrated OpenCV. This allows us to process images in real-time, enabling the robot to detect and identify objects on the field, such as game elements and targets. Our vision algorithms have been optimized for speed and accuracy to provide critical information during matches.

- **Limelight**: We have incorporated the Limelight camera system for advanced targeting and tracking. With Limelight, our robot can easily lock onto specific targets, making it more effective in gameplay scenarios that require precise aiming and alignment.


### Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance the functionality of our library! If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or shoot an email to ftcrobosapiens@gmail.com

### Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the FTC community for their ongoing support and collaboration. Special thanks to the developers of Roadrunner, OpenCV, and Limelight for providing such valuable tools that significantly enhance our robot's performance.
